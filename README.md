## Overview: No Code What???

Hi! My name is Jeremy Sher and I'm a senior engineer at Knack, an online database and application building platform, where I mostly write JavaScript. At the same time, I haven't really spent a lot of time using the system as an end user and decided to use Hack for a Cause as an opportunity to change that. For my solution to Parenting Now's requirements, I used the Knack platform to create a secure online portal where Parenting Now's educators can manage attendance reports, snack assignments, summary reports, and other data that is currently being managed on paper using paper forms.

## Features

- Secure login with multiple user roles (educators, administrators)
- Display session schedule in calendar format with more info per session
- Create attendance reports per family and session
- Create summaries for sessions and groups
- Create snack assignments linked to sessions/families
- Allow export of email list in Access-friendly format (CSV with mail merge named columns)
