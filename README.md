## Overview

Hi! My name is Jeremy Sher and I'm a senior engineer at Knack, an online database and application building platform, where I mostly write JavaScript. I haven't really spent a lot of time using the system as an end user, though, so I decided to use Hack for a Cause as an opportunity to take a deep dive into building apps on the platform I spend my time working on. For my solution to Parenting Now's requirements, I used the Knack platform to create a secure online portal where Parenting Now's educators can manage attendance reports, snack assignments, summary reports, and other data that is currently being managed on paper using paper forms.

## A Note on Knack

Knack is a paid service, and while it aims to be an affordable platform not everyone has a technical budget. Knack is proud to offer significant discounts to non-profit organization, and to celebrate Hack for a Cause will provide a one-year non-profit starter plan subscription for this solution should it be adopted.

## Features

- Secure login with multiple user roles (educators, administrators)
- Display session schedule in calendar format with more info per session
- Migrate paper forms to online forms
  - Attendance reports by family and session
  - Summaries for sessions and groups
  - Snack assignments by session
- Export of email list in Access-friendly format (csv with columns matching example xls)
