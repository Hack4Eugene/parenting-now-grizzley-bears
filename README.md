## Overview

Hi! My name is Jeremy Sher and I'm a senior engineer at Knack, an online database and application building platform, where I mostly write JavaScript. At the same time, I haven't really spent a lot of time using the system as an end user and decided to use Hack for a Cause as an opportunity to change that. For my solution to Parenting Now's requirements, I used the Knack platform to create a secure online portal where Parenting Now's educators can manage attendance reports, snack assignments, summary reports, and other data that is currently being managed on paper using paper forms.

## A Note on Knack

Knack is a paid service, and while it aims to be an affordable platform not everyone has a technical budget. Knack is proud to offer significant discounts to non-profit organization, and to celebrate Hack for a Cause will provide a one-year non-profit starter plan subscription for this solution should it be adopted.

## Features

- Secure login with multiple user roles (educators, administrators)
- Display session schedule in calendar format with more info per session
- Migrate paper forms to online forms
-- Attendance reports by family and session
-- Summaries for sessions and groups
-- Snack assignments by session
- Export of email list in Access-friendly format (csv with columns matching example xls)

### TODO

- Set up import from existing data?
