## Overview: No Code What???

Hi! My name is Jeremy Sher and I'm a senior engineer at Knack, an online database and application building platform, where I mostly write JavaScript. At the same time, I haven't really spent a lot of time using the system as an end user and decided to use Hack for a Cause as an opportunity to change that. For my solution to Parenting Now's requirements, I used the Knack platform to create a secure online portal where Parenting Now's educators can manage attendance reports, snack assignments, summary reports, and other data that is currently being managed on paper using paper forms. While a no code solution like this can be a lot easier to use for less technical people, it was a real challenge to exclusively use the visual builder tools and not write any code!

## A Note on Knack

Knack is a paid service, and not everyone has a technical budget. Knack is proud to offer significant discounts to non-profit organization, and for Hack for a Cause will provide one year of the non-profit starter plan, to showcase the value it can provide to an organization like Parenting Now.
